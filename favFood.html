		yeah sure it sounds super complicated, but trust me its super simple
		<br>

		<ol>
			<li> fresh pasta! make a mound of all your pasta and create a little well in the center  </li>
			<li> crack all three of your eggs into the center </li>
			<li> beat the eggs with a fork and gradually beat the flour in </li>
			<li> once its all incorporated , knead for five minutes until a smooth, cohesive, and firm dough forms </li>
			<li> let the dough rest for up to thirty minutes, and at this point the dough can be stored in a fridge for up to 24 hours </li>
			<li> once it is done resting, divide the dough in half and roll one half of it out into a large sheet, aim for a 14 in by 16 in rectangle </li>
			<li> alternatively, use a pasta roller </li>
			<li> once your pasta is nice and flat, cut it and shape it into whatever shape you want.<br>
			       	aglio e olio is best with some linguini, so don't flatten your pasta too much and cut out strips of about a tenth of an inch  </li>
			<li> dust and toss the pasta in some flour </li>
			<li> on the stove, get the olive oil nice and hot. once the oil starts shimmering, dump in the garlic and sautee until toasty brown </li>
			<li> in a bot of boiling water dump in your pasta. becasue this is fresh pasta, we don't need to boil it as long. about two minutes will suffice for al dente pasta</li>
			<li> once the pasta is cooked al dente (or however you prefer), grab the pasta and dump it into the oil and garlic with some of the pasta water </li>
			<li> throw in your chili flakes, finely chopped parsley, and squeeze in the lemon juice </li>
			<li> toss the pasta (or stir or you're not confident in your tossing abilities </li>
			<li> enjoy a dish made of a handful of simple ingredients, and embodies when the whole is more than the sum of its parts </li>
